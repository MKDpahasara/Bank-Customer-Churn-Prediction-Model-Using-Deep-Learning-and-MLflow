# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Model-Using-Deep-Learning-and-MLflow
This project develops a deep learning model to predict bank customer churn. By analyzing customer data. the model identifies customers likely to leave. MLflow is used to track experiments and manage the model. The project aims to help banks focus on retaining at-risk customers and improve their retention strategies.

# Data Preparation:
The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and encode categorical variables. This ensures that the data is clean and suitable for deep learning algorithms.
# Deep Learning Model:
A deep neural network is built and trained to capture complex patterns and relationships within the data. The model is fine-tuned to optimize performance and accuracy in predicting customer churn.
# Model Evaluation:
Various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are used to evaluate the model's performance. This helps in understanding its effectiveness and making improvements if necessary.
